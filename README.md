- Plus, an easy-to-implement SDK to integrate access control seamlessly into your applications.

## Installation

To install the Authify SDK, execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm install authify
```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Import the SDK

Import the `AuthifyClient` module into your Node.js application after installing the Authify package:

```javascript
import { AuthifyClient } from "authify";
```

### Step 2: Initialize the SDK

Initialize the Authify SDK with your API key obtained from the Authify dashboard:

```javascript
const authify = new AuthifyClient({
  token: "[YOUR_API_KEY]", // Replace with your actual API Key
  host: "http://127.0.0.1:8080", // Modify according to your Authify application host
  defaultTenant: "global", // Optional: Specify a default tenant, defaults to "global" if not set
});
```

## Using the SDK

### Checking Permissions

To perform a permission check, use the `authify.check()` method with the following parameters:

- `user`: A unique string identifier for the user performing the action.
- `resource:action`: The resource and action in the format "resource:action".
- `options` (optional): Can specify more options:
  - tenant: Specify a different tenant to check permissions against, if not the default.
  - metadata: An object of key value pairs for any data you want to store.

Example:

```javascript
const allowed = await authify.check("johnny@authify.in", "profile:read", {
  tenant: "global",
  metadata: {
    endpoint: "/api/test",
    key1: "value1",
  },
});

if (allowed) {
  console.log("Access Granted: Johnny can read the profile.");
} else {
  console.log("Access Denied: Johnny cannot read the profile.");
}
```
